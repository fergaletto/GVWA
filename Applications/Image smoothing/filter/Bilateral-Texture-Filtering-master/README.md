# Bilateral Texture Filtering

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the bilateral texture filter from the paper Cho, H., Lee, H., Kang, H., and Lee, S. 2014. Bilateral texture filtering. ACM Trans. Graphics 33, 4, 128:1-128:8.

In addition, over 30 example images with a variety of textures are included in the "images/" folder to evaluate the implementation. Each image is named "name-k-iter.ext", where "k" and "iter" are the best patch size and number of iterations selected for the image.

To run the algorithm, simply update the input image I, patch size K, and number of iterations ITER in "main.m" file; and then type "main" in the MATLAB console.

If you have any questions regarding the implementation, please feel free to email me at FIRST.LAST@eecs.berkeley.edu, where FIRST and LAST are replaced by my Chinese first and last name.

Thanks,
